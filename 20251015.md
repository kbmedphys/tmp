## Nowcasting using Mixed-Fequency Dynamic Factor Models

In macroeconomics, we often have hundreds of indicators — GDP, employment, prices, production — observed at different frequencies, sometimes with missing data. Analyzing them jointly is difficult because of their high dimensionality and missing data at different frequencies.

Dynamic Factor Models solve this problem by summarizing co-movements across many series into a few latent factors. These factors capture the common dynamics of the economy, allowing us to monitor and predict economic activity in real time.

The model assumes that each observed variable is driven by a small number of latent factors. The loading matrix links those factors to the observed variables, and the factors themselves follow a vector autoregressive process.

**Dynamic Factor Models**

DFMs are based onfundamental idea that a large number of economic variables ($N$) how similar develoments over the buines cycles and thus an be descrived by a small number of common factors ($r$), i.e., $r\lt N$.

**Model Structure**

Observed variables ($y_t$) are driven by unobserved dynamc factors $f_t$:

$$
y_t=\Lambda f_t+\epsilon_t
$$

**Model dynamics**

Comon factors are modeled as Gausian autoregression processes, AR(1):

$$
f_t=Af_{t-1}
$$

**Mixed-Frequency Dynamic Factor Model**

Weekly and monthly mixed frequency data, along the lines descrived by Mariano and Murasawa (2010): 

$$
y_t^{W}=\Lambda_{W}f_t+\epsilon_t^{W}
$$

$$
y_t^{M}=\Lambda_{M}\frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=0}^m f_{t-j}+\epsilon_t^{M}
$$

The model can also forecast future values or interpolate missing observations, such as predicting the unobserved months of quarterly GDP.

Model parameters are estimated using the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm.  In the E-step, the latent factors are inferred using the Kalman filter and smoother; in the M-step, parameters like factor loadings and variances are updated.

As new monthly data arrive, the Kalman filter updates the factor estimates and immediately revises the GDP nowcast, making this framework one of the most practical and interpretable tools for real-time macroeconomic analysis.

## Regime Identification using Statistical Jump Model

Statistical Jump Model is a novel framework for identifying market regimes and structural breaks in financial and macroeconomic time series.

This is a unsupervised algorithm based on the principle of clustering temporal eatures while simulaneously imposing penalties for each jump in the hidden state sequence.

When $\lambda$ is set to zero, the jump model becomes the K-means algorithm which does not take the temporal order into account. As we increase value of $\lambda$, the number of state transitions decreases.

$$
\argmin_{\Theta, S}\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}l(y_t,\theta_{S_t})+\lambda\sum_{t=1}^{T-1}1_{\{s_{t-1}\neq s_{t}\}}
$$
