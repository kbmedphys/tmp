### 1. Nowcastng using Mixed-Fequency Dynamic Factor Models

Macroeconomic indicators are released infrequently and with publication lags, limiting real-time assessment of economic conditions.  

**Mixed-Frequency Dynamic Factor Models (MF-DFMs)** address this by summarizing co-movements across many series into a few latent factors that capture the common dynamics of the economy.

#### Model Structure

Weekly and monthly **mixed frequency observed variables ($y_t^W, y_t^M$)** are driven by unobserved dynamc factors $f_t$:

$$
y_t^{W}=\Lambda_{W}f_t+\epsilon_t^{W}
$$

$$
y_t^{M}=\Lambda_{M}\frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=0}^m f_{t-j}+\epsilon_t^{M}
$$

The loading matrix $\Lambda$ links those factors to the observed variables, and the factors themselves follow AR(1) process.

Parameters are estimated via the **EM algorithm**, and real-time updates are performed using the **Kalman filter** when new data arrive.

#### Practical Outcomes

The model can also forecast future values and interpolate missing observations—for example, predicting the unobserved weeks within a monthly CPI series.

#### Applications

- Real-time tracking of GDP growth or business-cycle momentum.

- Estimate inflation before official CPI release.

- Combine multiple markets into a single “financial conditions” or “macro momentum” index.

### 2. Regime Identification using Statistical Jump Model

The **Statistical Jump Model (SJM)** extends clustering by penalizing excessive regime changes.  

It differs from Hidden Markov Models by enforcing persistence through a **jump penalty** rather than transition probabilities.

#### Objective Function

It estimates the state assignments $S=\{s_t\}$ and cluster parameters $\Theta=\{\theta_k\}$ by minimizing the following objectve function:

$$
\mathcal{L}(S, \Theta)=\sum_{t}\ell(y_t;\theta_{S_t})+\lambda\sum_{t}1_{\{s_{t}\neq s_{t-1}\}}
$$

where:

- $y_t​\in \mathbb{R}^D$ : feature vector at time $t$,

- $\ell(y;\theta)=\frac{1}{2}​∥y−\theta∥^2$ : loss function (squared Euclidean distance),

- $s_t\in\{0,1,...\}$ : regime labels.

- $\lambda\ge 0$ : controls regime persistence. When $\theta=0$, the model collapses to ordinary clustering. Larger values of $\lambda$ yields more persistent regimes.

#### Practical Outcomes

The SJM is deterministic and more stable — it produces clearer and more
interpretable regime segmentation.

#### Applications

- Applied to macro indicators (e.g., inflation, GDP growth) to detect macro regimes.

- Detecting bull vs. bear market regimes from price or volatility features.

### 3. Online Portfolio Selection using Regret Minimization

At each time t, the investor chooses a portfolio weight vector $x_t​∈\Delta_n​={x_i\ge 0,\ ∑_i​x_i​=1}$.

The **Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)** framework minimizes cumulative regret compared with the best fixed portfolio in hindsight. 

$$
R_T=\sum_{t=1}^Tf_t(x_t)-\min_{x\in \Delta_n}\sum_{t=1}^Tf_t(x),
$$

#### Algorithm

Uses exp-concave losses such as $f_t​(x)=−\log(r_t^{\top}​x)$ with $L_2$​ regularization:

$$
x_t=\argmin_{x\in\Delta_n}\sum_{s=1}^{t-1}f_s(x)+\frac{1}{2}\gamma||x||_2^2.
$$

#### Practical Outcomes

FTRL-based online portfolio selection enables **stable and adaptive investment strategies** that continuously adjust to market changes while preventing overreaction to short-term noise.  
By incorporating regularization (e.g., entropy or log-barrier), portfolios remain **diversified, smooth, and robust**, achieving competitive long-term growth with **provable regret guarantees** — making it practical for **real-time asset allocation, index tracking, and algorithmic trading**.

#### Applications

- Dynamic Asset Allocation: Adjusting weights online based on recent returns while controlling turnover.

#### Limitation

- **Strong convexity assumptions:** Needed for logarithmic regret, but not always satisfied in real markets.

### 4. Mean-Variance Reinforecement Learning

Traditional Reinforecement Learning (RL) maximizes **expected reward**, ignoring **risk**. 

In finance, both **mean and variance** of returns matter (Markowitz trade-off). 

#### Objective Function

This is equivalent to optimizing a **quadratic utility**, producing a **Pareto-efficient policy** for each λ. 

Use standard **policy-gradient** (e.g., REINFORCE / Actor-Critic).

$$
\max_{\pi} J(π)=\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[R]−\frac{λ}{2​}\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[R^2]
$$

#### Practical Outcomes

Enables **data-driven, risk-aware decision-making** without explicit variance constraints.

Produces **Pareto-efficient policies** interpretable via the risk–return frontier.

#### Applications

- Learn investment policies balancing expected return and volatility; generate efficient frontier strategies.
