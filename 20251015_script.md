Thank you for this time.  

Today, I’d like to introduce several research topics.

I’ll talk about four frameworks.

Firstly, the **Mixed-Frequency Dynamic Factor Model**, which is used for real-time macroeconomic nowcasting.

Secondaly, the **Statistical Jump Model**, a method for identifying structural regime changes in economic and financial data.

Thirdly, the **Online Portfolio Selection** framework, which uses regret minimization.

And finally, the **Mean-Variance Reinforcement Learning** approach, which combines portfolio theory with reinforcement learning.

### 1. MFDFM

Let’s start with the **Mixed-Frequency Dynamic Factor Model**.

Economic indicators come at different frequencies — monthly, quarterly, even weekly.

Because of that, it’s difficult to analyze them together in real time.

The **Dynamic Factor Model** addresses this by summarizing co-movements across many variables into just a few **latent factors**.

These **latent factors** represent the **common movements** in the economy — like the underlying business cycle.  

The **MF-DFM** combines data of different frequencies — for example, **weekly financial data** and **monthly CPI**.  This lets us **nowcasting**.

Technically, we estimate the model using the **Expectation–Maximization algorithm**.

In the **E-step**, the **Kalman filter** extracts the hidden factors, and in the **M-step**, we update the model parameters.

As new data come in, the Kalman filter updates the estimate values, so our nowcast is **always up to date**.

In practice, it’s used for **real-time GDP tracking**, **inflation monitoring**,  
and building **financial condition index**.

It’s one of the most practical tools for real-time macroeconomic analysis.

### 2. SJM

The second framework is the **Statistical Jump Model**.

This model is designed to detect **market regimes** and **structural breaks**.

The basic idea is simple.  Each time point is assigned to a **latent state**, and whenever the state changes, the model pays a **penalty**.

This penalty discourages excessive switching.  

As a result, the model detects only **meaningful and persistent regime changes**.

In technical terms, it minimizes a **penalized loss function**, balancing accuracy and smoothness.

Compared to the **Hidden Markov Model**,  the Statistical Jump Model is **stable**, and **easy to interpret**.

The **lambda parameter** plays a key role —  smaller values detect more regime chenges, while larger ones suppress regimes changes.

In practice, this model is applied to detect macro regimes, identify volatility clusters, and **regime-aware portfolio strategies**.

In short, it provides a **clear and data-driven way** to understand how the economy or markets **shift from one state to the others**.

### 3. FTRL

The third method is **Online Portfolio Selection** using **Follow-the-Regularized-Leader**.

The idea is that an investor updates portfolio weights at each time step to minimize the **regret** —  
Regret is the gap between the performance we actually achieved and the best fixed portfolio we could have chosen in hindsight.

The loss function is usually the **negative log return**,  and we add a **regularization term** to keep the portfolio smooth and diversified.

This prevents the algorithm from over-reacting to short-term noise and helps maintain stability over time.

Mathematically, the update rule is given as follow:

In simple terms, the portfolio is updated according to past performance,  
with a regularization term to keep the adjustments smooth.

In practice, it’s used for:  
– **Dynamic asset allocation**

One limitation is that it assumes **convexity**, which doesn’t always hold in real financial markets.

Still, in many empirical studies, it performs **remarkably well** —  
providing smooth and adaptive investment strategies that respond intelligently to market changes.

### 4. MVRL

Finally, let’s move to the **Mean-Variance Efficient Reinforcement Learning** framework.

The key idea is to bring the **mean-variance trade-off** — the foundation of Markowitz portfolio theory — into **reinforcement learning**.

In standard reinforcement learning, the goal is simply to **maximize expected reward**.  But in finance, we also need to control the **risk**.

So, the objective function is given as follow:

as a **quadratic utility function**.

where **λ** is the **risk-aversion parameter** that determines how much we penalize volatility.

This formulation directly balances **return and risk**, just like an investor optimizing a portfolio.

As a result, the learned policies are **Pareto-efficient**.

In other words, you can not get higher returns without taking on more risk.

It forms a **bridge between reinforcement learning and modern portfolio theory**,  combining classical risk management with a **data-driven learning framework**.

To summarize,

- The **MF-DFM** supports real-time macroeconomic analysis,

- The **Statistical Jump Model** detects structural regime changes,

- The **FTRL framework** adapts portfolios with minimal regret,

- And **Mean-Variance Reinforcement Learning** learns risk-aware investment strategies.

Each framework aim to make financial decision-making more intelligent and interpretable.

Thank you very much for your attention.
